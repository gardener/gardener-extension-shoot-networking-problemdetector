# [Gardener Extension for Network Problem Detector](https://gardener.cloud)

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-shoot-networking-problemdetector)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-shoot-networking-problemdetector)

Project Gardener implements the automated management and operation of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) clusters as a service.
Its main principle is to leverage Kubernetes concepts for all of its tasks.

Recently, most of the vendor specific logic has been developed [in-tree](https://github.com/gardener/gardener).
However, the project has grown to a size where it is very hard to extend, maintain, and test.
With [GEP-1](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/proposals/01-extensibility.md) we have proposed how the architecture can be changed in a way to support external controllers that contain their very own vendor specifics.
This way, we can keep Gardener core clean and independent.

This controller implements Gardener's extension contract for the `shoot-networking-problemdetector` extension.

An example for a `ControllerRegistration` resource that can be used to register this controller to Gardener can be found [here](example/controller-registration.yaml).

Please find more information regarding the extensibility concepts and a detailed proposal [here](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/proposals/01-extensibility.md).

## Extension Resources

Currently there is nothing to specify in the extension spec.

Example extension resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: Extension
metadata:
  name: extension-shoot-networking-problemdetector
  namespace: shoot--project--abc
spec:
```

When an extension resource is reconciled, the extension controller will create two daemonsets `nwpd-agent-pod-net` and `nwpd-agent-node-net` deploying
the "network problem detector agent".
These daemon sets perform and collect various checks between all nodes of the Kubernetes cluster, to its Kube API server and/or external endpoints.
Checks are performed using TCP connections, PING (ICMP) or mDNS (UDP).
More details about the network problem detector agent can be found in its repository [gardener/network-problem-detector](https://github.com/gardener/network-problem-detector).


Please note, this extension controller relies on the [Gardener-Resource-Manager](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/concepts/resource-manager.md) to deploy k8s resources to seed and shoot clusters.

## How to start using or developing this extension controller locally

You can run the controller locally on your machine by executing `make start`.

We are using Go modules for Golang package dependency management and [Ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo)/[Gomega](https://github.com/onsi/gomega) for testing.
